# Autonomous Sprint Cycle (ASC) — AI-Driven Project Management Methodology

**A strategic framework for AI-driven project management where autonomous routines collaborate to detect, execute, review, and iterate work — with the human executive as strategic decision-maker.**

---

## Executive Philosophy

> "The Executive decides. The system executes."

The Autonomous Sprint Cycle is designed so an executive can:
1. Review work from mobile devices (cloud-based dashboards)
2. Make strategic decisions with streamlined interfaces
3. Provide strategic guidance through comments and directives
4. Focus on high-value activities while the system handles execution

**The AI operates as Chief of Operations, not an assistant.** It analyzes situations, challenges assumptions, and proposes strategic alternatives. Final decisions remain with the executive.

### Support Functions
| Process | Schedule | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **System Maintenance** | Sunday 4am | Infrastructure hygiene |
| **Analytics Review** | Monday 8am | Performance metrics |

## Workflow Segregation Rules

```
Technical deliverables (github_link present)  →  Development Sprint only
Business deliverables (non-technical, light)  →  Operations Sprint only
Heavy deliverables (content, draft, strategy) →  Direct session only (cron skips)
Executive-reviewed items                      →  Integration Manager only
Active project comments from executive       →  Board Audit + executing Sprint
```

### Ticket Weight Classification

Every ticket has a `deliverable_type` that determines routing:

| Type | Weight | Handled By | Examples |
|------|--------|------------|----------|
| `research` | Light | Operations Sprint | Audits, evaluations, analysis |
| `code` / `pr` / `feature` | Light | Development Sprint | PRs, features, fixes |
| `config` / `ops` | Light | Operations Sprint | Setup, configuration |
| `report` | Light | Operations Sprint | Automated reports |
| `content` | **Heavy** | Direct session only | Blog posts, long-form content |
| `draft` | **Heavy** | Direct session only | Long drafts for review |
| `strategy` | **Heavy** | Direct session only | Roadmaps, planning |
| `routine` | N/A | Cron routines | Recurring system tasks |

**Heavy tickets require direct executive-AI collaboration.** Autonomous routines skip them and report them as "skipped — direct session only."

---

## Executive Decision Framework

When reviewing completed deliverables:

| Action | System Response | Executive Use Case |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Approve** | Mark complete, close workflow | Deliverable meets requirements |
| **Expand** | Generate derivative tasks | Work reveals additional opportunities |
| **Request Analysis** | Generate detailed report | Need additional context for decision |

**Default behavior:** Auto-approval for routine deliverables.

---

## Information Architecture

1. **Dual-channel delivery:** All deliverables accessible both technically and via executive interface
2. **Mobile-first design:** Assume executive access primarily through mobile devices
3. **Primary delivery: Notion** (rich content, navigable, mobile-friendly)
   ```
   Executive Workspace (Notion)/
   ├── Reports/           ← Intelligence reports, analysis
   ├── Daily Briefing/    ← Daily executive summaries
   ├── Ideas & Research/  ← Findings, explorations
   └── Drafts/            ← Content drafts for review
   ```
4. **Secondary delivery: Google Drive** — Only for slides, spreadsheets, binary files, or sharing with third parties
5. **Technical backup:** Workspace filesystem (source of truth for code/configs)
6. **Ticket linking:** Every completed ticket must have a `doc_link` pointing to Notion or Drive

## Risk Mitigation (Lessons Learned)

| Risk Factor | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Auto-expansion of tasks | Scope creep, resource waste | Executive approval required for expansion |
| Process overlap | Duplicate work, inefficiency | Clear workflow segregation rules |
| Disconnected development | Technical work without business alignment | Mandatory business case documentation |
| Mobile access gaps | Executive bottlenecks | Cloud-first delivery architecture |
| Incomplete analysis | Poor executive decisions | Verification requirements for all metrics |
| Lost strategic insights | Missed opportunities | Automated intelligence registration |
| Deployment gaps | Features developed but not activated | Automated integration post-approval |

---

## Comparison with Traditional Frameworks

| Aspect | Traditional Agile | Autonomous Sprint Cycle |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Planning | Meeting-based, human-intensive | Automated analysis and prioritization |
| Daily Updates | Synchronous meetings | Asynchronous executive briefings |
| Execution | Human-driven development | AI-driven autonomous execution |
| Review | Stakeholder meetings | Mobile executive review |
| Retrospectives | Meeting-based process improvement | Continuous methodology evolution |
| Backlog Management | Manual curation | AI-driven opportunity identification |
| Quality Assurance | Human QA role | Automated board audit process |
| Deployment | Manual release management | Automated integration pipeline |

**Strategic Advantage:** While traditional frameworks require constant human coordination, ASC enables strategic oversight with autonomous execution, allowing executives to focus on high-level decision-making rather than operational management.

---

## Implementation Roadmap

For organizations adopting the Autonomous Sprint Cycle:

1. **Foundation:** Establish Board Audit + Integration Manager
2. **Operations:** Implement Operations Sprint for business processes
3. **Development:** Add Development Sprint for technical initiatives
4. **Intelligence:** Deploy Intelligence Gathering for market awareness
5. **Executive Interface:** Create Executive Brief for daily oversight
6. **Workflow Rules:** Define clear process segregation
7. **Decision Framework:** Implement executive review interface
8. **Integration:** Connect to executive dashboard infrastructure

Each process includes detailed operational procedures and success metrics.
